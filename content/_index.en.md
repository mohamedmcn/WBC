# World Boxing Council

### -History

The World Boxing Council (WBC or WBC) was initially created by 11 countries: the United States, Argentina, England, France, Mexico, the Philippines, Panama, Chile, Peru, Venezuela and Brazil (Puerto Rico joined in Mexico City on February 14, 1963, invited by the then President of Mexico, Adolfo López Mateos), to create an organization that would manage to unify all the commissions in the world to control the expansion of boxing.

The groups that were historically recognized by the majority of boxers at the time were: the New York State Athletic Commission, the National Boxing Association, the European Boxing Union and the British Boxing Board of Control. But these groups, contrary to popular belief, could not cover the entire “international” territory.

The World Boxing Council sanctions the World Boxing Championships, and is one of the four largest organizations recognized by the International Boxing Hall of Fame, along with the World Boxing Association, the International Boxing Federation and the World Boxing Organization. . {{% / expand%}}
