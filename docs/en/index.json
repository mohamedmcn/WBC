	"content": "Heavyweight Heavyweight, also sometimes called heavyweight or maximum weight, is a competitive category in boxing and other combat sports, which groups together competitors of considerable weight.\nIn professional boxing it is the maximum weight category, including all male boxers over 91 kilos and female boxers over 81. In amateur boxing (older men) the category encompasses boxers who weigh more than 81 kilos (176 lb) and less than 91 kilos (201 lbs). In men\u0026rsquo;s professional boxing, the immediate previous category is cruiserweight, while in women\u0026rsquo;s it is light heavyweight. In amateur boxing, the immediate previous category is light heavyweight and the next superior category is super heavyweight.\nHeavyweight is one of boxing\u0026rsquo;s eight traditional categories: fly, bantam, feather, light, welterweight, medium, light heavy, and heavy.\nThe term is also used to designate a category of other combat sports such as kickboxing and taekwondo.\nHistory Because it is a category with no weight limit, historically the conditions for fighting in it have been vaguely described. For example, in the 19th century, many heavyweight champions did not exceed 77 kilograms (170 pounds), while others exceeded the 91 kilograms (200 pounds) that today sets their minimum.\nEarly heavyweight champions include Slave Tom Molineaux, Jack Slack, Jem Belcher, Ben Caunt, and Jem Mace.\nThe first heavyweight champion under the Marquis of Queensberry Rules was John L. Sullivan, known as \u0026ldquo;The Strong Boy from Boston.\u0026rdquo; He was defeated by Jim Corbett on September 7, 1892, in 21 rounds.\nIn recent years the title has been fractured by the existence of various world associations that usually recognize various boxers as such. Therefore, the expression \u0026ldquo;undisputed champion\u0026rdquo; is often used for those cases in which all associations recognize him.\n"

	"content": "World Boxing Council -History The World Boxing Council (WBC or WBC) was initially created by 11 countries: the United States, Argentina, England, France, Mexico, the Philippines, Panama, Chile, Peru, Venezuela and Brazil (Puerto Rico joined in Mexico City on February 14, 1963, invited by the then President of Mexico, Adolfo López Mateos), to create an organization that would manage to unify all the commissions in the world to control the expansion of boxing.   Read more   The groups that were historically recognized by the majority of boxers at the time were: the New York State Athletic Commission, the National Boxing Association, the European Boxing Union and the British Boxing Board of Control. But these groups, contrary to popular belief, could not cover the entire “international” territory.\nThe World Boxing Council sanctions the World Boxing Championships, and is one of the four largest organizations recognized by the International Boxing Hall of Fame, along with the World Boxing Association, the International Boxing Federation and the World Boxing Organization. .\n \n"
